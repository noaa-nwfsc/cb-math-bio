# Spawner-Recruit estimation

These are R packages used for fitting spawner-recruit functions to data from salmonid populations.  The output is posterior distributions of the estimated spawner-recruit functions.  These posteriors are used in a variety of analyses (such as risk impact analyses or forecasts) in order to incorporate the uncertainty in the underlying population dynamics into the analysis.
